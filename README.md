# In The Moment Weather Reports

A dynamic HTML, CSS and JavaScript web application for people who want to keep track of a city's weather, and create their own personal weather reports with images to either agree, disagree or somewhat agree with the local forecast.  

Long are the days over where one has to second guess the local weather station's accuracy; In The Moment Weather Reports lets **you** be the weatherman!

This idea was my primary motivation for building this application - growing up I'd always look forward to forecasts by my local weather channel stating that "**HOORAH** school is closed tomorrow! 12 inch snowfall expected overnight!", only to be dissapointed by a blaring alarm at 6 in the morning with less than a feather's worth of snow on the ground, and school being open after all; ruing the idea of ever depending on a weather channel's accuracy in the first place.
